# Hi there! :)

👨‍💻 <br>
I'm Sennen, a student in Software Engineering based in the Hague, The Netherlands. During my time at The Hague University of Applied Sciences (THUAS), I've learned about OOP, Webdevelopment, Data Science and Databases, individually and in projects with fellow students. 

Right now, I'm following a Minor programme in Data visualisation. Starting my internship in September 2025!

I believe the best way of working is in a team. Where knowledge is shared, people feel safe and it's okay to make mistakes. We can strengthen eachother to achieve great results. Continuous personal and professional development is very important to me, and I'm always up for a challenge.

In my free time I love keeping up with the latest tech, listening to music, audio, Tang Soo Do / Korean Karate, which I also teach! Huge F1 fan, too.
